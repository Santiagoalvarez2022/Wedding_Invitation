# Project: Mobile-Only Wedding Website

## Description
This project is a mobile-only website designed for a couple who were getting married. With their consent, I have included this work in my portfolio. The site allows guests to RSVP and choose gifts they wish to give to the couple.

## Features
- **RSVP:** Guests can indicate whether they will attend the wedding or not.
- **Gift Selection:** Guests can view a list of desired gifts and select those they wish to give.
- **Spreadsheet-Based Management:** To reduce implementation costs, the site is designed to directly modify a spreadsheet. This way, the couple can see real-time information on attendance and gifts without the need for an API.

## Benefits
- **Cost Reduction:** By not requiring an API and directly modifying a spreadsheet, hosting and maintenance costs are significantly reduced.
- **Easy Access:** Designed to be accessible from any mobile device, making it easy for all guests to use.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** [Specify the frontend technologies used, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, specific frameworks, or libraries if applicable].
- **Backend/Integration:** Utilization of scripts for direct integration with spreadsheets [specify the technology or service used, for example, Google Sheets API].

## Lessons Learned
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of integrating web applications with spreadsheets, optimizing for mobile devices, and the importance of creating cost-effective solutions for clients.
